				<p>The Department of Buildings ensures the safe and lawful use of 950,000 properties and buildings in New York City by enforcing the Building Code and Zoning Resolution. The DOB maintains a Building Information System which is an informative website you may find helpful in your research.
				Notices of violations are issued for violators in various categories, and vary from DOB violations, ECB violations, and criminal summonses. Not all violations are adjudicated. The advice of an experienced consultant can make a difference.</p>

				<h4><b>Does it have to be this obvious?</b></h4>
				<p>Section 28-301.1 (27-127) of the Building Code -Maintenance requirements, all buildings and all parts thereof shall be maintained in a safe condition. All service equipment, means of egress, devices, and safeguards that are required in a building by the provisions of this code or other applicable laws or regulations, or that were required by law when the building was erected, altered, or repaired, shall be maintained in good working order. Actually, maintenance should really reflect the quality of construction.</p>

				<p>The DOB monitors construction in NYC from approving plans, inspecting the construction site for the sake of public safety, etc. If conditions permit, a violation is issued as a form of enforcement procedure, or a “stop work order” may be issued and thus not allow you to continue any work other than making the construction site safe, if it is necessary.</p>

				<h4><b>Violations:</b></h4>
				<p>The Dept. of Buildings issues a variety of violations, ranging from violations that do not carry a fine, to criminal summonses which can lead to an arrest warrant. Most violations issued, are simply an order to correct a violating condition. Some violations qualify for a hearing at the Environmental Control Board (ECB), where you may present a defense to dismiss the violation. The presiding Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) may accept testimony and evidence and forward their recommendation to the Commissioners’ designee for final decision and order.</p>

				<h4><b>Admit and Pay:</b></h4>
				<p>Effective September 22, 2010, respondents who receive a Department of Buildings violation, and wish to admit the charge, can pay the minimum penalty by mail anytime before – or on the day of – the scheduled hearing date at the ECB. <br>
				To deny the charge of the violation, you must attend the hearing at ECB on the date provided.</p>

				<h4><b>Non-hazardous violations:</b></h4>
				<p>You have three options: <br>		
				1.	Cure– You can file a certificate of correction with the DOB. In it, you admit that the condition or conditions causing the violation existed, and you sign and notarize a statement that states you corrected the condition(s). This must be filed within 35 days from the day the violation was issued, to avoid a fine for the violation and avoid having to appear at theEnvironmental Control Board (ECB) before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at a hearing. But if you file the certificate late, or if an inspector inspects the building and finds that you didn’t really correct the condition, you must appear at the hearing, where you can then challenge the violation. You may only certify correction if the entire condition alleged on the notice of violation were corrected. In the event that the issuing offer cited two or more violating conditions, they must all be corrected before the certificate of correction will be approved. After you certify correction of the violation, the DOB should send you a letter letting you know that it has accepted your certificate of correction. If you didn’t get this letter, you should appear at the ECB hearing. <br>
				2.	Contest– You may choose to appear before an ALJ on the hearing date indicated on the notice of violation to challenge the violation. For example, say you get a violation for making illegal alterations. If you don’t want to remove those alterations, you may want to challenge the violation by showing the ALJ why they aren’t illegal.</p>
